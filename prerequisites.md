**Prior to the workshop, it is vital that you install some software on your laptop and create an account at Github by following the instructions below!**

There is little time during the workshop to deal with installation problems, so it makes the day run much more smoothly if you arrive with your software already installed.

## Help!

We maintain a list of common problems that can occur during installation and ways of solving them. Take a look at the [Configuration Problems and Solutions wiki page](https://github.com/swcarpentry/workshop-template/wiki/Configuration-Problems-and-Solutions) for help.

If you still have trouble, then [email us](mailto:rsg-info@soton.ac.uk) and we will organise a time to meet. 


## Bash

Among many other things, Bash allows you to automate dull and boring tasks. We use it during the command line section of the course.

#### Windows

Bash will be provided as part of the Git for Windows installation as described below.

#### Mac OS X

The Bash shell is accessed by opening the "Terminal" application. The Terminal application can be found in the "Utilities" folder which is in your "Applications" folder.

#### Linux

The Bash shell is accessed via the Terminal application.

## Text Editor

A text editor is the piece of software you use to view and write code. If you have a preferred text editor, please use it. If you don&#39;t have one, we recommend the following.

#### Windows

[Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/download/v6.9.2.html). Just download the installer and run it.

#### Mac OS X and Linux

Nano is a text editor that is installed by default on Mac OS X and Linux.

You can verify you have nano installed by opening a terminal and entering:</p>

~~~ {.code}
nano
~~~

If nano is not installed, you will receive an error. If it is installed, nano will open (appearing not dissimilar to the terminal window, but with menu items at the bottom of the window).

To exit nano press CTRL+X (you might be prompted you to save or discard modified buffer - just type "N" to exit without saving).


## R

[R](http://www.r-project.org) is a programming language that is especially powerful for data exploration, visualization, and statistical analysis. To interact with R, we use [RStudio](http://www.rstudio.com/).

The "RStudio" installation provides everything R-related you will need for the workshop. To install RStudio, follow the instructions below.

#### Windows

[Video Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0PjTAylwoU).

Install R by downloading and running [this .exe file](http://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/release.htm) from [CRAN](http://cran.r-project.org/index.html). Also, please install the [RStudio IDE](http://www.rstudio.com/ide/download/desktop).

#### Mac OS X

[Video Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-ly3kyxwEg)

Install R by downloading and running [this .pkg file](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/R-3.3.2.pkg) (MacOS 10.9 and later) or [this .pkg file](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/R-3.2.1-snowleopard.pkg) (MacOS 10.6 - 10.8) from [CRAN](http://cran.r-project.org/index.html). Also, please install the [RStudio IDE](http://www.rstudio.com/ide/download/desktop).

#### Linux

You can download the binary files for your distribution from [CRAN](http://cran.r-project.org/index.html). Or you can use your package manager (e.g. for Debian/Ubuntu run:

~~~ {.code}
sudo apt-get install r-base
~~~

and for Fedora run:
 
~~~ {.code}
sudo yum install R
~~~

Also, please install the [RStudio IDE](http://www.rstudio.com/ide/download/desktop).

## Git

Git is the version control software we will use. It allows you to keep track of your software and the edits made to it.

####Create a Github account

**You  must create a Github account before attending the workshop!**

To create an account, [go to the Github website](https://github.com/join) and provide your details. It's quick and it's free. Once you have your account, you need to install the Git software as described below.

#### Windows

Download and install [Git for Windows](http://git-scm.com/download/win). **Please note** that you can accept the default installation options, **with one exception** - at the step 'Configuring the terminal emulator to use with Git Bash' you **must** select 'Use Windows default console window'.

#### Mac OS X

On Mac OS X 10.11 El Capitan, 10.10 Yosemite and 10.9 Mavericks, Git will be installed automatically the first time you try to run it.  Open a terminal and enter:

~~~ {.code}
git
~~~

There may be a short delay whilst the installer operates. You can then follow the prompts to install the Apple command line development tools.

On Mac OS X 10.6 Snow Leoapard, Mac OS X 10.7 Lion and 10.8 Mountain Lion, download and open the [Git installer image](http://downloads.sourceforge.net/project/git-osx-installer/git-2.3.5-intel-universal-snow-leopard.dmg?r=http%3A%2F%2Fsourceforge.net%2Fprojects%2Fgit-osx-installer%2Ffiles%2F&ts=1441637770&use_mirror=kent). Double click the `.pkg` file and follow the instructions.

If you intend to use an earlier version of Mac OS X, please contact us before the event.

#### Linux

Install via a terminal like this:

Ubuntu 14.04LTS and derivatives:

~~~ {.code}
sudo apt-get install git
~~~

Fedora 22:

~~~ {.code}
su -
dnf install git
~~~

If anything fails, please [contact us](mailto:rsg-info@soton.ac.uk) before the workshop.

## During the workshop

We will make use of the [Etherpad](https://public.etherpad-mozilla.org/p/SWC-ESRCDTCSoton-Nov2016) collaboration tool during the workshop (Etherpad allows a group to edit documents online collaboratively in real-time). Please use this to keep collaborative notes and ask (and answer!) each others questions.
